          Integrated client's Enterprise Landing Zone, IaC Deployment and Persona Based IAM Framework with their ServiceNow Systems, from both tooling and process persepctives.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Developed the Migration Engine for lifting VMWare/Hyper-V workloads to Azure. The engine consumes data from Azure Migrate assessments and Azure Landing Zone then automatically creates solution design diagram and datasheet declaring workload's Azure target state. Once the design is approved, it only takes a button click to migrate the workload into Azure.

          Led the implementation of 2 critical Azure Kubernetes clusters for a large fund management client. Splitting the IaC into serveral layers, Terraform to deploy the core AKS clusters and their supporting Azure services, another Terraform repo to manage namespaces and their respective roles and role bindings, and Helm to deploy the actual application workloads along with sidecars. With all the layers of the infrastructure codified and managed via gitops, the client teams were able to take ownership of this rather complex system with ease.

          Homebrew Terraform Landing Zone Solution before CAF supermodule
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Developed and delivered an Enterprise Scale Landing Zone for one of the largest government agency in NZ, with Terraform, Azure Policy and Azure DevOps.The solution extended on the Cloud Adoption Framework principles and adopted a multi-layered approach which consisted of Security and Compliance layer, Network Layer, Monitoring and Alerting Layer, and Workload Layer. Each layer is managed by its own pipeline and state file, which ensures segregation of duties for different internal IT teams. The network topology is global transit network with cross-region hubs to support their intertional locations. The Landing Zone provided baselines and guardrails for the agency to meet compliance and security requirements as well as unified and centralised control plane for their future Azure workloads.

          Principal Cloud Consultant
        description: |
          Being a Principal Consultant, I'm responsible for the delivery and growth of our key accounts. For the one which I've been the site lead from the beginning, an initial Well Architected Framework assessment turned into a program of work that has lasted for more than 18 months and consists of 6 SoWs and 2 parallel streams. We manage to significantly improve their Cloud ROI by uplifting tools, processes, and people capabilities. Client Satisfaction has constantly been at the top. 

          I'm also part of the Azure Practice Leadership and have led the development of multiple Azure offerings including Enterprise Scale Landing Zone, FinOps Framework, and OpenAI accelerator. I also organised regular mentoring sessions and Azure cert jam for our internal consultants to improve their capability in Azure space.

          Principal Azure Consultant
        description: |
          As a principal consultant at Lab3, my main responsibility is to own the end-to-end delivery of a solution. Solution can either be a client engagement, or one phase in a larger program of work, or a feature of an internal product. I'm responsible for leading a small squad consisting of developers and DevOps engineers. I have basically been wearing the hats of pre-sales, scrum master, technical escalation point, cheerleader and the one managing expectations of external clients, internal client executives and product owners for the team. 

          I'm often the designer of the solution and the one with a holistic understanding of the problem we are trying to solve. I hold very close relationships with my teammates, I understand their strength, their challenges. their work (and life) priority and their career ambition through regular catch-ups and performance reviews. Another part of my job is to be the trustworthy non-sales person to address client's concerns and enquiries throughout the engagement. I'm a major contributor to coding standard, re-usable patterns, modules and libraries within the company.
